If you cast harrowing on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, \u201chunting down the pirate king,\u201d or \u201ctraveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword\u201d) that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell\u2019s duration. If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards.\nRecord the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card\u2019s alignment matches the target creature\u2019s alignment. If the card and target\u2019s alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit\u2019s check. If the card and target\u2019s alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a \u20131 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit\u2019s check.\nWhile penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can \u201cspend\u201d at any time to modify that card\u2019s associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell\u2019s duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.\nA single creature can only be under the effects of one harrowing at a time. If it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous harrowing is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.\nRange touchTarget one creature, plus one additional creature for every 3 caster levelsDuration 1 day\/level or until fulfilled\nThis spell functions as harrowing, except it can affect an entire group of creatures and allows its subjects some measure of control over their destiny. Subjects of a greater harrowing spell record and spend their accumulated bonuses and penalties individually, according to their own alignment.\nEach participant in a greater harrowing can gain a special ability to seize control of fate if a card that matches that participant's alignment is drawn. Like the bonuses and penalties granted by the spell, the special ability can be used once before the end of the spell's duration. The exact ability gained depends on the card's suit; if multiple cards that match a participant's alignment are drawn, the participant can select one suit of her choice during the spell's casting.\nHammers: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you can reroll any bull rush, grapple, or sunder combat maneuver checks. You must use the result of this second roll, even if it is worse.\nKeys: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain evasion, as the rogue class feature. If you already possess evasion, you instead gain improved evasion, as the advanced rogue talent.\nShields: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain fast healing 1 and don't die until you reach a number of negative hit points equal to double your Constitution.\nBooks: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain a +3 enhancement bonus on checks with all skills you have no ranks in, and you can use those skills even if they can't normally be used untrained.\nStars: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain immunity to one of the following (your choice): charm and compulsion effects, curse effects, or fear effects.\nCrowns: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, whenever you succeed at a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to improve a non-hostile creature's attitude toward you, that creature's attitude toward you becomes helpful for the remaining duration of the Charisma bonus, regardless of the number of steps by which you would normally improve its attitude. The creature reverts to its original attitude after the duration expires.\nA single creature can be under the effects of only one harrowing or greater harrowing at a time. If the subject is targeted with a second harrowing or greater harrowing spell while a previous harrowing or greater harrowing is s till affecting him, the new spell automatically fails for that subject.\nPathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide. \u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Keith Baker, Wolfgang Baur, Clinton J.
