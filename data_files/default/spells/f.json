When you summon the creature, you decide if it is a celestial (angel, avoral, or guardinal), fiend (daemon, demon, or devil), or elemental (air or fire); this choice has no effect on the creature's abilities (though if you have an ability that augments or extends spells you cast that summon certain creatures it has the normal effect).\nThe focus is a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle.\nFly, Illusory\nThis spell functions like fly, except that rather than being sustained by magic, the target grows a pair of wings made of shadow that allows him to fly.\nThe wings work best in shadowy illumination or darkness, where they allow the target to fly as described in the fly spell.

If the line of effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point to that location.
