A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. \nYou choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.\nTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\nFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\nCounterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.\nTarget or Area one spellcaster, creature, or object; or a 20-ft.-radius burst\nThis spell functions like dispel magic, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures. \nYou choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell:\nTargeted Dispel: This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.\nAdditionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.\nArea Dispel: When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\nFor each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\nCounterspell: This functions as dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.\nWhen used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you\u00a0heal\u00a01d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this\u00a0healing\u00a0applies only to the highest-level spell dispelled. If you use this spell to\u00a0counterspell, roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result."},{"Name":"Displacement","School":"illusion (glamer)","Level":{"alchemist":3,"bard":3,"magus":3,"sorcerer\/wizard":3,"summoner\/unchained":0},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","M":"Material (a small loop of leather)"},"Range":"touch","Target":"creature touched","Duration":"1 round\/level (D)","Saving_Throw":"Will negates (harmless);","Spell_Resistance":"yes (harmless)"},{"Name":"Disrupt Link","School":"abjuration","Level":{"antipaladin":2,"bard":3,"inquisitor":3,"sorcerer\/wizard":2,"witch":2},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic"},"Description":"Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft.\/level)Targets one creature and her animal companion, familiar, or other bonded creature (which may be no more than 30 ft. apart)Duration 1 round\/levelSaving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes\nGet this book AND support this site!\nThe target has her link with her bonded creature temporarily severed.

If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \"Come here,\" \"Go there,\" \"Fight,\" and \"Stand still.\" You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.\nOnce you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).\nChanging your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.\nBy concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.

At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.\nOnce the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.\nIf the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell.\nCreatures who don't sleep or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell.\nThe messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always failing any saving throw) while in the trance.\nYou or the messenger may gain information from the dreamer you contact by asking questions as if using\u00a0speak with dead\u00a0to speak with a corpse. An unwilling dreamer can attempt to resist this probing with a\u00a0Will\u00a0save (as\u00a0speak with dead, using the DC\u00a0dream\u00a0would have if it allowed a saving throw).
