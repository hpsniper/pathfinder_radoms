You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.\nUnless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first.

It is merely a post to the Paizo boards by this spells original designer meant to clarify his intent and concept when creating this spell. This information is presented merely to help understand how the designer intended it to work. As usual, how it ACTUALLY works is up to the GM.\n\"Actually, the basis of this spell is grasping hand, and since that is based upon interposing hand you're going to see a lot of the same language used from that spell as well.\nSo, it is an auto-attacker, like grasping hand; but what the spell doesn't say (and perhaps it should) is that designating a new target is a move action. The language concerning moving it within the 30-ft. range was added in editorial review.\nThe intent is the chain does one of the listed combat maneuvers once per round.\nFYI: This was ultimately inspired by Marvel's Ghost Rider, and a little bit of The Christmas Carol (i.e. Jacob Marley). As a force construct, it's a way to drag around ghosts, shadows, spectres and the like. Of course, it has more applications than just that, but that's where the name comes from.\"\n[Source]"},{"Name":"Chains of Fire","School":"evocation [fire]","Level":{"magus":6,"sorcerer\/wizard":6},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic","F":""},"Description":"\nRange medium (100 ft. + 10 ft.\/level)Targets one primary target, plus one secondary target\/level (each of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)Duration instantaneousSaving Throw Reflex half; Spell Resistance yes\n\nThis spell functions like chain lightning, except as noted above, and the spell deals fire damage instead of electricity damage."},{"Name":"Chains of Light","School":"conjuration (creation) [good]","Level":{"cleric":6,"inquisitor":5,"paladin":4,"sorcerer\/wizard":6},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic","F":""},"Range":"short (25 ft. + 5 ft.\/level)","Target":"one creature","Duration":"1 round\/level (D)","Saving_Throw":"Reflex negates;","Spell_Resistance":"no","Description":"A creature targeted by this spell is held immobile by glowing golden chains composed of pure light.

The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas.\nLower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates).

You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with create lesser demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day\/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nAlignment: Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.\nBountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.\nElemental: Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water-\nelemental dominant trait.\nGravity: By default a demiplane\u2019s gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane\u2019s gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional.\nSeasonal: The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every  4 hours, and so on).\nShape: By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.\nStructure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp. If you have cast create demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u2019s area requires its own permanency spell.\nCreate Demiplane, Greater\nEffect extradimensional demiplane, up to 20 10-ft. cubes\/level (S)\nThis spell functions as create demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with lesser create demiplane or create demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day\/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any of the features described in create demiplane) with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nEnergy: Your plane gains the (minor) negative- or positive-\ndominant energy trait. A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits.\nMagic: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait. If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \u201ceffects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\u201d or \u201cdeath spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.\u201d A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.\nMorphic: You may use move earth at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell\u2019s normal casting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal.\nPortal: Your demiplane gains a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it).\nTime: By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 22,500 gp. If you have cast create greater demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u2019s area requires its own permanency spell.\nCreate Demiplane, Lesser\nRange 0 ft.Effect extradimensional demiplane, up to three 10-ft. cubes\/level (S)Duration 1 day\/levelSaving Throw none; Spell resistance no\nYou create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \u201cwalls\u201d and \u201cceiling\u201d of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane\u2019s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane\u2019s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane\u2019s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade.\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection, etherealness, or plane shift. You are considered \u201cvery familiar\u201d with your entire demiplane.\nAs a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish, mage\u2019s disjunction, miracle, or wish and making a successful dispel check.\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u2019s area requires its own permanency spell."},{"Name":"Create Food and Water","School":"conjuration (creation)","Level":{"cleric\/oracle":3,"shaman":3},"Casting_Time":"10 minutes","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic"},"Description":"Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft.\/2 levels)Effect food and water to sustain three humans or one horse\/level for 24 hoursDuration 24 hours; see textSaving Throw none; Spell Resistance no"},{"Name":"Create Holds","School":"transmutation","Level":{"druid":4,"ranger":3,"sorcerer\/wizard":4},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic","M":"Material (handful of pebbles)"},"Description":"Range  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft.\/level)Effect path of handholdsDuration 1 hour\/level (D)Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no\nYou create a path of handholds on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden walls.\u00a0\nRestriction: You can not create handholds on walls made of metal or other, harder materials.\nThe handholds are created in pairs and are approximately 3 feet apart, located in a specific path indicated by your gestures while casting the spell.

You must create the pit on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.  Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling into it (see Editor's Note).  In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it.  Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.\nCreatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The pit's coarse stone walls have a Climb DC of 25.

The type or types of undead you can create are based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.\nYou may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.\nThis spell must be cast at night.\n1 A huecuva can be created using create undead. The caster must be at least 11th level and the spell normally uses the body of an evil cleric. The spell can be used to create a huecuva using the body of a good cleric, but this requires a DC 20 caster level check. Creating a huecuva in this way is considered to be one of the most heinous things that can be done to a cleric that has passed away. The faithless aura of huecuvas created from the bodies of good clerics in this way grants a +4 profane bonus on Will saves to resist channeled energy and any effects based off that ability.\n2 The create undead spell can create festrogs as if they were ghasts. The caster must be able to cast contagion, have access to that spell in a scroll or other magic item, or work with another caster who has access to the spell; creating the festrog expends the prepared contagion spell, uses an appropriate spell slot, or a charge from the magical source. If the corpse to be animated died of necrotic boils (the disease that festrogs spread) the contagion spell is not necessary.\n3 A spellcaster of 14th level or higher can create a blast shadow using create undead. In addition to the normal components of the spell, the spellcaster must use the body of a creature that died as a result of a fire spell or effect. The spell must be one that affects an area. Scorching ray is not sufficient, but fireball is. The creature must have died within 24 hours of the casting of create undead.
