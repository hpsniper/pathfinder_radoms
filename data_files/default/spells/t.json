No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally.

All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.\nThe mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance but not necessarily its form.

However, only the topmost face is visible at any one time.\nTransplant visage may also be used to remove a previously stolen face. This is the only way to remove a face short of using greater polymorph, miracle, or wish. When used in this way, transplant visage causes the topmost face to flake off and crumble into dust.
