As the spell is cast, the dead body\u2019s flesh unravels like ribbons to sheath the living target, who must be of a similar shape to the corpse and be within one size category of the corpse\u2019s size. While casting the spell you must remain in contact with the corpse while holding the focus item to the living target. At the spell\u2019s completion, the living target gains the appearance and any size bonuses or penalties of the new form, along with any of the dead creature\u2019s extraordinary abilities or natural abilities (such as natural attacks or senses), but not the creature\u2019s racial bonuses or any spell-like or supernatural abilities.

The effects are instantaneous, so no magic lingers on the victim. If subjected to detect magic, the target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives of an aura of strong necromantic magic. True seeing does not reveal the target\u2019s true form, since the disguise itself, while magically achieved, is a mundane (but masterful) disguise. The spell detect undead, however, does note the target as an undead creature with the same number of Hit Dice. The target is not truly undead, though, and is not affected by any other effect that targets undead creatures. Recorporeal incarnation does nothing to disguise the target\u2019s alignment.\nIf the target of recorporeal incarnation dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any  resurrection or similar spell cast upon the target resurrects the target, not the corpse flesh. Since recorporeal incarnation destroys the majority of the body\u2019s physical remains, the dead body cannot be restored to life via raise dead\u2014only resurrection, true resurrection, miracle, or wish can restore such a creature to life."},{"Name":"Reduce Animal","School":"transmutation","Level":{"druid":2,"ranger":3},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic"},"Range":"touch","Target":"one willing animal of Small, Medium, Large, or Huge size","Duration":"1 hour\/level (D)","Saving_Throw":"none;","Spell_Resistance":"no"},{"Name":"Reduce Person","Description":"School transmutation; Level\nalchemist 1, bloodrager 1, magus 1, sorcerer\/wizard 1, summoner\/unchained summoner 1, \nwitch 1\nThis spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8.

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.\nSince the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.\nA reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.\nIt's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.\nFor a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below.

This has three effects.\nFirst, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).\nSecond, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, cure light wounds cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast prayer, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target\u2019s friendship with the cleric.\nThird, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.\nThis powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.\nThis mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use atonement to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; remove curse also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation."},{"Name":"Repulsion","School":"abjuration","Level":{"cleric\/oracle":7,"inquisitor":6,"sorcerer\/wizard":6,"summoner":5,"unchained":0,"protection":7},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic","F\/DF":""},"Range":"up to 10 ft.\/level","Area":"up to 10-ft.-radius\/level emanation centered on you","Duration":"1 round\/level (D)","Saving_Throw":"Will negates;","Spell_Resistance":"yes"},{"Name":"Residual Tracking","School":"divination","Level":{"ranger":1},"Casting_Time":"1 minute","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic","M":"Material (a bit of plaster)"},"Description":"Range touchTargets footprint touchedDuration instantaneousSaving Throw none; Spell Resistance no\nBy touching a footprint, you receive a clear mental image of the person or creature that made it.
