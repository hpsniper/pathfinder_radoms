A zone of foul flames looks unremarkable to the casual observer, but a Perception check (DC = 20 + the caster\u2019s level) reveals a faint rippling effect in the area, as if of heat distortions in the air.\nWhenever a creature casts a spell with the fire descriptor or activates a magical fire effect (as from a magic item or a special attack) while that creature is located in a zone of foul flames, that creature takes full fire damage from the effect. If the effect allows a saving throw to reduce the damage, the victim may attempt the same saving throw to reduce the damage. All creatures in a zone of foul flames gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against fire effects, except for those made by a creature attempting to save against fire damage from his own magic. Nonmagical fire in a zone of foul flames burns half as brightly but is otherwise not affected."},{"Name":"Zone of Silence","School":"illusion (glamer)","Level":{"bard":4},"Casting_Time":"1 round","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic"},"Description":"Range personalArea 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on youDuration 1 hour\/level (D)"},{"Name":"Zone of Truth","School":"enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]","Level":{"cleric\/oracle":2,"inquisitor":2,"paladin":2,"witch":2},"Casting_Time":"1 standard action","Components":{"V":"Verbal","S":"Somatic","DF":"Divine Focus"},"Range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft.\/2 levels)","Area":"20-ft.-radius emanation","Duration":"1 min.\/level","Saving_Throw":"Will negates;","Spell_Resistance":"yes"}]
